    <h1>Welcome to My Story, written by AlexIsOK</h1>
    <p>Hello!  I am a developer, and my name is Alex (as you might be able to guess).  I have been programming for the
    majority of my life (4th and 5th grade), and even as a child, I wanted to learn as much as I could about computers, as back then I had no idea
    how they worked.</p>
    <p>Now: programming, learning, and reading are the only three things that really make me happy anymore, and that's 
    why I made my username AlexIsOK, because <b><i>I am OK!</i></b>  OK?  OK.  Seriously though, I'm OK...</p>
    <p>Anyways, if you couldn't already tell, I have autism.  I'm not about to get into that because it's really just hard to
    talk about and every time I try to talk about it I get really upset.</p>
    <p>If you want to contact me, feel free to email me.  Otherwise, there's not much else about me that's interesting.
